<h2>About me </h2>

<p>
    I like to ride a bike, travel, chat with friends and just usefully spend time. I work in the field of web programming. I like to read dystopias.

<h2>What can be found here</h2>

<p>
    I opened this site primarily for my friends and acquaintances. Here I spread mainly reports about my travels, photos and some thoughts about everything.

    Leave a comment, if you like a story, this is the best motivation for me to write more!

<p>
    Now this site is also a testing ground for technology.
    There is <a href="/api/documentation" target="_blank">RestAPI</a> and <a href="/graphql?query=query{news(first:10){data{id%20text}paginatorInfo{currentPage%20lastPage}}}">graphql</a>
    (<a href="/gql/schema.graphql" target="_blank">schema</a> ) in order to test applications and various frameworks.
