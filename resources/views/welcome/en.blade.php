<h2>What can be found here</h2>

<p>
    I opened this site primarily for my friends and acquaintances. Here I spread mainly reports about my travels, photos and some thoughts about everything.

<p>
    I think that the best thing about a person is his work. Therefore, there is only what I did myself.
